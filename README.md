### 🧭 About Me

I don’t just write code — I **explore** with it.

I'm a builder, a researcher, and a restless mind deeply curious about how intelligence emerges — in machines, systems, and the universe. My work spans **AI**, **machine learning**, **IoT**, and **robotics**, but always with one goal: to push the boundary of what’s possible and meaningful.

- 🔬 Currently: **Lead Data Science Intern** at Blink Analytics, leading work on **LLMs**, **RLHF**, and **AI-based evaluation systems**.
- 🌊 Former AI Intern at **Seaweeds**, where I built systems to predict **Harmful Algal Blooms**.
- 🛸 Builder of a **custom drone** with a self-designed PCB, flight controller, and real-time stabilization algorithms.
- 🛰️ Researching **predictive maintenance** for rocket engines using multivariate time series and transformer models.
- 💡 Advisor at **Mind Ripple**, PDEU's quizzing and knowledge club — where we ask the questions Google can’t answer.

### 🚀 What Drives Me

> "Curiosity is not a trait — it's a fuel."

Whether it's a small system or a planetary-scale problem, I explore with tools like Python, TensorFlow, and hardware integrations — blending science fiction ideals with real-world engineering.
